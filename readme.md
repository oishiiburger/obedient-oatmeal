Obedient Oatmeal
================

This is a fun script written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to generate random band names.

As configured the script will generate a name of between 1 and 4 words. If the length of the name is 1, it will be a noun. If it is greater than 1, any of the words except the last may be adjectives.

The `noun.csv` and `adj.csv` contain a noun list and adjective list, respectively, in comma-separated value format.

Usage
-----

From the directory which contains all the files:

```
python3 obedientoatmeal.py
